# on-stream-close

**Callback when a stream has closed.** Alternative to [`stream.finished`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_stream_finished_stream_options_callback) and its predecessor [`end-of-stream`](https://github.com/mafintosh/end-of-stream) that utilize other events (like `end` and `finish`) which makes them compatible with older streams but they can't guarantee the stream has fully cleaned up its resources.

- [`readable-stream`](https://github.com/nodejs/readable-stream): >= 3.5.0 if `autoDestroy` is set to `true` by implementation
- [`streamx`](https://github.com/mafintosh/streamx): always
- [`minipass`](https://github.com/isaacs/minipass): not out of the box, an implementation can choose to emit close.
